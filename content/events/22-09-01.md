We are doing an Open Lake Seeding together with CFARMC-Rotary Community Corps at RC San Pedro. 

Over 30,000 pieces of Tilapia fingerlings were given by the Provincial Government of Laguna with the help of Governor Ramil Hernandez, as part of the Laguna Lake rejuvination program at the municipal waters of San Pedro City.

The project is an initiative of Engr. Enrique H. Layola, head of San Pedro City Agricultural Office, together with:
- Mr. Marlon Tobias, Provincial Agriculturist ng Laguna
- Mr. Renato Olivarez, Pangulo ng CFARMC
