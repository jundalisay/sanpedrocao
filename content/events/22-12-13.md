As part of the San Pedro City government’s agenda in reviving and improving the agriculture sector of the city, the City Agriculture Office (CAO), through the initiatives of Mayor Art Mercado, held an informative demonstration of Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) or hydroponics and turn-over of NFT kits at the Pacita Elementary School earlier today (December 13).

The program aims to enhance and empower the agriculture sector of the city, as well as to make it a sustainable livelihood for various groups and communities in the city.

Participants of the demonstration and beneficiaries of the Nutrient Film Technique kits were Representatives and members from the San Pedro Employees Association, Makabagong Ina at Kababaihan tungo sa Pag-Asenso (MIKA), Duck Raisers Association, Solo Parents Group of San Pedro, and Young Proactive – San Pedro.

Hydroponics is a technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, or perlite.
Hydroponics advocates claim this method is healthier than organic growing, they leave no residue in cultivated produce, more people can be fed, and less precious natural resources are used. The produce also usually comes out much healthier and more flavorful.
