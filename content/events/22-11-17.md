As per Executive Order 19 "Issuance of Suggested Retail Price of Some Agricultural Basic Necessities and/or Prime Commodities in the City of San Pedro", the city government is establishing Suggested Retail Price (SRP) for agricultural basic necessities and commodities.

We are reminding:
- all sellers to follow the SRP. 
- all buyers to be vigilant and coordinate with the City Agriculture Office if there are violators of Executive Order 19.

Thank you for your cooperation.
