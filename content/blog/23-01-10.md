San Pedro is strategically located near Laguna Lake and has access to aquatic resources within the city's waters. 

This is why we aim to protect the aquatic resources and the livelihood of the fisherfolks of our City. 

With this objective, the City Government of San Pedro has created City Ordinance No. 2022-193 or “An Ordinance Creating the City of San Pedro’s Bantay-Lawa Task Force, Providing Implementing Rules and Regulations and Appropriating Funds Thereof”.

This is to promote, safeguard and regulate the exploitation, utilization, conservation and management of the fisheries and aquatic resources within the jurisdiction of the City of San Pedro Laguna.
